When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
    - For team work
    - When working from several locations or from several computers

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
	- You have control on the stuff that is updated on your side
	- You don't want getting changes from other team members without knowing when they happen
	- You can control the conflicts when you are ready for them

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
	- Forks are a copie of a git repository on the GitHub servers
	- Clones are local copies of either a local repository or a Git repository
	- Branches are diversions from the master branch within a repository
